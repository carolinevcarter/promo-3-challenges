    <h3> Show Synopsis </h3>
     <p> If you think the advertising business is a rough place to work in present day, you haven't lived in the 1960s. Mad Men takes us back to New York in the '60s, when the advertising agencies just about ruled the world. The men were pioneers in the field, while the women were trying to make their mark in the business world.
     </p>

    <p2> The agency is enjoying success, but the advertising game becomes more competitive as the industry develops. The agency must adapt to ensure its survival. Don Draper is a talented ad executive at the top of his game, but the secrets from his past and his present threaten to topple his work and family life.
